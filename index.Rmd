## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r load data}
url<- "http://data.humdata.org/dataset/8d7280c6-f696-4342-9e1f-c326eac897ca/resource/5bc4591d-6b95-430a-82a8-03cfea172da3/download/indicator_data_ua.csv"
download.file(url=url,destfile = "data/UAindicators.csv")
df <- read.csv("data/UAindicators.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
